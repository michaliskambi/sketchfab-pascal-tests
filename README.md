# Using Sketchfab API to search and download glTF (for Castle Game Engine)

Use Sketchfab API to perform:

- search in Sketchfab for given query string (`cthulhu` by default)
- download a glTF file
- For extra effect, at the end it opens resulting glTF with view3dscene.

Purpose: Sketchfab integration with [Castle Game Engine](https://castle-engine.io/) editor.

The code defines a nice reusable `TSketchfabModel` class, that holds various information about the model:

- model ID (used to later download the model)
- name
- description
- face count
- license
- thumbnail URL (Sketchfab provides thumbnails of various sizes, we choose the one closest to 256x256)

All in clear modern Object Pascal.

The code uses some _Castle Game Engine_ API (like `CastleLog`, `CastleDownload`). In principle, if needed, you could likely make it independent of CGE (e.g. use `TFPHTTPClient` from FPC for all HTTP communication, instead of CGE `TCastleDownload`).

## Usage

* Get your Sketchfab token from https://sketchfab.com/settings/password , paste it into `sketchfab_token.inc` file here (this file is ignored by `.gitignore`)

* Build and run the application:

    ```
    castle-engine compile --mode=debug
    ./sketchfab_download
    ```

    Response should be like this:

    ```
    Log for "sketchfab_download".
    ....
    Got response, storing in response-search.json (for debug)

    ```

* Pass a command-line parameter to change the query. It is `cthulhu` by default. Use anything else, this is just a query string for Sketchfab, you can look for anything on Sketchfab. E.g. run

    ```
    ./sketchfab_download castle
    ```

* By default is downloads the first search hit, but you can easily customize it.

    * Click on the list of URLs in console to easily inspect the models.

    * If you want to download a particular model, then comment out

        ```
        Model := TSketchfabModel.SearchGetFirst(Query);
        ```

        in code with a simple hardcoded value for your model, e.g.

        ```
        Model := TSketchfabModel.Create;
        Model.ModelId := '42002fa6abcc41e18abeb3da9edca096';
        ```
